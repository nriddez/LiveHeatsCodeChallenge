I used some of the design from the real webpage to make it reliable with LiveHeats, and the look of the site. 
The tasks from the challenge I made in JS, HTML and CSS.
Fill in the name of the Race, number of students in the race and then Create the race.
Furthermore it's possible to fill in the name of the student and the place for each lane.
